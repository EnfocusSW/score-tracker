# Score Tracker

The [Score Tracker](https://www.enfocus.com/en/appstore/product/score-tracker) app follows the live matches on the [Statorium](https://www.statorium.com/) site.  
What leagues and seasons are being watched depends on the API key.

It is available on the [Enfocus Appstore](https://www.enfocus.com/en/appstore/overview).

Are you a big [Enfocus Switch](https://www.enfocus.com/en/switch) fan and a football fan at the same time?

This app is for you! It will **track** the live matches results automatically.  
After each match, a Switch job will be created with private data and a dataset.

The **private data** will include the **names** of the two teams, the url of their **flags**, and their **results**.  
The **dataset** will include more **details**, like who scored at what time, the number of yellow cards, red cards, etc.

Using this metadata, you can filter the matches you are interested in.

You can use this job as a trigger to send an email. We provide a mail template, but feel free to create your own.

Or even better, use your **imagination** to celebrate the matches or the results of your favorite team in a crazy way. You can create a poster and print it automatically, or create a [Switch script](https://www.enfocus.com/en/switch/modules/scripting-module) using some [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/) to send a tweet, fire up smart lights, start a playlist or celebration song, â€¦ and let the party begin!
